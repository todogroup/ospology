# Welcome to the OSPO Mind Map ðŸ§­

The OSPO Mind Map schemes the main Open Source program Office's responsibilities, roles, behavior and team size within the Ecosystem. An interactive OSPO Mind Map version can be found at: https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/

This folder contains the resulting mind map, and is open and available to everyone that would like to provide feedback and help to improve its content.

## ðŸ“š About OSPO Mind Map Project

The Mind map is structured into four main areas:

* Responsibilities
* Roles
* Behavior
* Team Size
The initial [mind map](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions/75#discussion-3962305) was created using MindMup2.
However, in order to ease community contributions, a second version of this mind map was created using [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) that is managed as markdown that renders an interactive mind map. See Mind Map Syntax below for notes on how to use it.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

This folder contains four main resources:

| Folder | Extension | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
