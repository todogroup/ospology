## About OSPOlogy

OSPOlogy is an initiative under the TODO group which offers best practice sharing online workshops open to all, from folks just starting their OSPOs to seasoned OPSOers! These sessions typically are led by a TODO member covering one topic or sharing their organization&#39;s OSPO journey.

For further details see https://github.com/todogroup/ospology

## Problem statement

The OSPO movement is expanding across industries and regions of all types and sizes. Due to the wide range of responsibilities and ways to operate, OSPO professionals usually find it difficult when it comes to implementing OSPO best practices, policies, processes, or tools for their open source management efforts.

To help people with their open source challenges.

## Introducing OSPOlogy workshop

We are introducing a new framework for in-person OSPO workshops so people can talk openly about their organization&#39;s open source challenges and work together on shared solutions. The workshop initiative aims to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics to help organizations effectively implement OSPO Programs based on specific region needs.

Topics range from safely using open source to license compliance, sustainability, contributing back to the community, and more. For the full list of OSPO-specific topics please see [https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/).

### The workshop framework

In a nutshell, the framework defines the following workshop:

- Follows an unconference style meaning it&#39;s a participants-driven meeting
- Aim is to share openly and learn from each other under Chatham house rule and connect OSPOs with various open source communities involved in the open source activities that matter to them (e.g. os policies, tooling, standards, and community building)
- It is a 2-day in-person event, part prepared presentations, part hands-on workshop, and of course, there is space for networking.
- Is under Linux Foundation policies and code of conduct
- Participants can register their interest to receive an invite via [Linux Foundation&#39;s community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group-europe/) as seats are limited.
- Location is to be provided by one of the participants for free
- Each participant pays for their own food, travel, and lodging. Lunch and dinners may be free if workshop organizers find sponsors.
- Linux Foundation and TODO group can help with promoting the workshops via various communication channels (social media, mailing lists, newsletters, etc.).

### Unconference style

Typically at an unconference, the agenda of the workshop part is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space.

OSPOlogy workshops are not fully an unconference as the first day is a series of prepared presentations so you know the sessions before joining (1 or 2 will be participants chosen). For Day 2 the workshop is the unconference part where participants vote on topics to be worked on that day. Participants may be asked to submit their topic before the workshop to accelerate/simplify the voting process.

### Suggested workshop sections

- OSPO USE CASES ➡️ _Description: expert-led panels or talks to share experiences and case studies from specific OSPOs_

- OSPO ACCELERATORS ➡️ _Description: Presentation highlighting a specific activity within the [INSERT PROJECT NAME] such as outcomes of recent community activities. The aim of the presentation is to give people insights on various topics the communities are working on and get their feedback / to ask for contributions._

- SHARED CHALLENGES ASSESSMENT ➡️ _Description: Identify OSPO shared challenges / pain points on the OSPO mindmap and let the audience vote for the areas of interest (working groups) for the workshop breakout groups. For instance, focus areas can be specific activities within OSPO responsibilities._

- BREAK OUT SESSIONS ➡️ _Description:_ Define goals and identify pain points. Each break out group aims to capture their challenges for the selected focus and if possible document their experiences/solutions.

- NETWORKING


## Interested?

Efforts are already on the way to organize the OSPOlogy workshops in different European countries focused on the various OSPO responsibilities per quarter.

If you are interested in organizing an OSPOlogy workshop in your region feel free to contact:

- Ana Jimenez <ana@todogroup.org>
- Thomas Steenbergen <opensource@steenbe.nl>

There are two actors for OSPOlogy.live (1) the hosting party who makes available a meeting room and (2) the workshop organizer/facilitator in charge of workshop activities and planning. (1) and (2) may be the same entity/individual.

An individual may be qualified to be a OSPOlogy.live organizer (2) if:

1. Is a TODO Member
2. Is an OSPOlogy maintainer and the organization does not derive a significant portion of its revenue as a solution provider to other OSPOs

OSPOlogy.live hosts shall be responsible for:

- Approve/Decline workshop request: All voting is done via two-thirds majority of OSPOlogy.live organizers. In case of conflict resolution, the TODO Steering Committee will have the final oversight of the proposed workshop.
- Look for a host that makes available the meeting room
- Oversee workshop logistics
- Facilitate breakroom discussions
