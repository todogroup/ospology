# Creating an open source strategy

## Agenda

1.  Strategy for Outbound AND Inbound contributions
2.  Specify why or why not using / contributing to open source software (blockers)
3.  Return of Investment (RoI): identify key components and how to measure them
4.  Identify key actors and define a way to key them engaged
5.  Create strategy documents (one internal, one external)


## Topic 1: Inbound strategy

* IP protection
* Open Source Model: usage, participation, leadership
* How many components get used?
  * Take care of all dependencies. Invetory taking (SBoM)
* What to do when there are too many dependencies (when to green light / red light?)
  * Maybe not the strategy paper, but in the shape of a guideline
* What does belong to the checklist vs. strategy?
* How to effectively communicate the strategy in day-to-day operations / teams?
  * Dedicate more resources if it is critical
* Set up expectations of the need of education within the organization (so that executives know)
* Explain the different business models


## Topic 2: The value of strategic open source

-> Why using it? Why consuming it?

* Business oriented goal: based on the code product / service
  * How to make an impact?
  * Is it going to speed up the business?
  * Different goals
    * attracting talent
    * making open source project critical to the organisation more sustainable
    * Be independent of third party vendors / suppliers
* Main reasons are difficult to define
* Have i) a general high-level strategy and ii) a more granular strategy per product / business area, etc.

-> Should a strategy define where to find responsibility?
  * It should if you want to communicate what you consider a sustainable project for your organisation


## Topic 3: Return of Investment

Skipped due to time


## Topic 4: Key actors and target groups

Strategy paper (WHY) and guidelines (HOW)

* Keep global focus so that everyone can understand the strategy across teams
  (avoid too much technical depth)
* More technical ones can be created for specific teams to "speak" their
  language
* Should inspire and let other want to do things (create and manage
  expectations)
* Include end users into this target group


## Topic 5: Documentation

Documents

* Strategy paper
  * Umbrella strategy
    * Involves different actors (internal / external): stakeholders, suppliers
    * More suitable for large enterprises
    * What the problem of the industry and why going into a given direction?
  * product focused
    * What kind of open source projects to use or contribute depends on specific teams


What is out of scope of the strategy?

*  How-tos are out of scope of the strategy paper


## Bonus

Training programs and internal open source advisory to educate all teams.

**Group focused strategy paper and specific guidelines to open source
gets difficult to differentiate and is up to the organisation
mainly**
