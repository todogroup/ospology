# Minimum Viable OSPO

## Agenda

1.  Differences between OSPO patterns -\> ways to operate
2.  Minimum staff and responsibilities to get going
3.  Define the minimum value of an OSPO to get started
4.  Evaluation criteria path (process)
5.  How to measure the success of a minimum viable OSPO


## Topic 1: Difference between OSPO patterns

OSPO Persona for a minimal viable OSPO

* We...
  * are a small organization,
  * have legal checks in place which cover at least the risks,
  * have basic documentation of previous ad-hoc open source activities
    * But no clear connections between documents
    * The richness of these docs grows organically as more open source attention is needed

Next step / evolution of the Minimal Viable OSPO:

* Move to more community building (include in OSPO priorities)


## Topic 2: Minimal Staff and responsibilities

* Virtual team with part-time OSPO employees
* Depends on management buy-in and how open source is prioritized

* Minimum Viable Responsibilities
  * Open source strategy document
  * Secure management buy-in
  * Cross-team commitment generation
  * Delegation

* Need to conduct an evaluation of current state of open source in your organization
  and a definition of the wanted position in the short-term

* Legal expert
  * Should be within the OSPO?
  * Not necessarily a lawyer
  * Access to lawyers


Composition of a minimal viable OSPO

* Build-in
  * Manager (strategy, structure, goals)
  * Legal expert (not necessarily a lawyer, basic licensing)

* External to the OSPO
  * Marketing / communication
  * Community building consultants (project managers, DevRels)
  * Legal consultants

-\> Evolution path of the MVO

* What is external to the OSPO initially can be in-sourced over time


## Topic 3: Value Proposition

Reasons for creating an OSPO

* OSPO = vehicle for adoption of open source strategy
* Ease process to publish code
* Risk mitigation when open sourcing a project
* Properly formalize the open source efforts internal in the organization to allow growth in the long term
* Clarify responsibilities and commitment
* Being the linchpin between organization and open source ecosystem

A Minimal Viable OSPO **enables the transformation from Ad-Hoc Open Source to Sustainable Open Source.**
