This survey is part of a research project on the prevalence and outcomes of open source management within organizations and OSPO trends operating across sectors and regions. If you are part of an organization that is using and/or contributing to open source, and you are involved in open source management and operations, we need you!

Take the survey here: 

We are thankful for the support of Cisco, NGINX, InnerSource Commons Foundation, Open Source Initiative (OSI), and CHAOSS as advisors to and distributors of this survey.
