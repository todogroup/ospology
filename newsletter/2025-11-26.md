### OSPOCon at OSSummit + AI_dev Japan 2025

The TODO Group’s OSPOCon track at Open Source Summit + AI_dev Japan 2025 will bring together OSPO practitioners, open source program leaders, and ecosystem partners to share concrete experiences on open source governance, compliance, and strategy. Over two days of programming in Tokyo, OSPOCon will highlight how organizations in Japan and worldwide are building and evolving Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), supporting developers, and working with communities and regulators.
