# OSPO Newsletter 42

## TODO Group at FOSDEM 2026

TODO Group members were present at FOSDEM 2026 (January 31 – February 1, Brussels), the largest gathering of free and open source developers in Europe. With over 1,000 sessions across 71 tracks, it was a great opportunity to connect with the broader open source community and discuss OSPO practices, governance, and AI in open source.

<!-- TODO: Add specific sessions/highlights from FOSDEM once available -->
