### [A New Framework for In-Person OSPO Workshops: TODO Group Seeks Collaborators](https://todogroup.org/blog/new-framework-in-person-ospo-workshops/)

Piloting in Europe first, TODO is currently seeking for collaborators to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics and thus, help organizations effectively implement OSPO Programs based on specific region needs.

### [OpenSSF, OpenChain and ESOP support TODO as new OSPO Associates](https://todogroup.org/associates/)

The [OSPO Associate](https://todogroup.org/associates/) is a TODO Program that aims to work collaboratively across open source projects and communities that are helping the OSPO movement and improve OSPO-related resources and tooling. With the advice, help and expertise from these open source communities, we aim to work toguether to:

* Better assist OSPOs on ways to increase the security of the use of open source code, company-owned projects, and improve the security of upstream OSS they organization use and depend upon ([OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/))

* Better assist OSPOs on open standarts and open source compliance best practices and implementation ([OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/))

* Ease OSPO transition & improve its adoption in Portuguese public and private organizations ([ESOP](https://www.esop.pt/en))

> TODO Community participants coming from entities focused on [OSPO-related topics](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) who help OSPOs but may not have an OSPO can support TODO by becoming OSPO Associates. Learn more [here](https://todogroup.org/associates/).
