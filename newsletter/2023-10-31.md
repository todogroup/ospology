### Meet the Panelists for the First OSPO & Legal Mini Summit in Chicago on November 6th

Join us next week in Chicago for an exceptional opportunity, especially if you're attending KubeCon NA and are involved in Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) or legal teams. 
Don't miss the OSPOlogyLive NA Legal Edition —a unique event dedicated to fostering collaboration and understanding between OSPO and legal professionals.

This mini summit provides an open forum for discussion, complemented by a series of unconference sessions. The goal is to delve into the intricate relationship between AI compliance programs 
and cloud-native technologies, facilitating connections between OSPO teams / individuals, and the legal teams.
