# Business Benefits 

### Innovation

Even by just using open source projects, you’re able to take advantage of the experiences of a wide range of use cases, individuals and industries. When you become involved in open source projects and even publish your own, you’re able to more quickly see how a piece of software can be used in a variety of novel situations, and to get feedback on use cases and edge cases quickly. 

Open source projects have a much shorter feedback loop than closed-source projects. If you develop a piece of software primarily for internal use (ie, you are not a software vendor), the only feedback you’ll get is from users inside the company. As a result, you’ll likely miss a number of potential ways the software could be used, and you won’t see the situations where it could be used in different industries. 

### Improved engineering quality

One of the frequently cited advantages to becoming involved in open source is upskilling; in open source communities people mention the advantage of having many eyes examining the code for potential bugs, security or otherwise. Regardless, there is a psychological effect to knowing that your work will be visible to the entire world that tends to push engineers to write cleaner code. Multiplied over years of practice and over the entirety of your engineering team, this can amount to a significant improvement in engineering quality without any specific training. 

However, improvements to the engineering quality come from more than just the bright light shone on the codebase. Engaging with open source communities also gives engineers exposure to a wider range of experiences and a wider range of mentors. The number of people they will get feedback from is expanded, and as a result their skill level will improve. 

### Improved engineering velocity

There is no doubt that open source in general increases engineering velocity, even for those who are simply users of open source software without any additional involvement in the community. 

For engineering teams that become contributors or who publish and maintain their own projects, the velocity advantages can be significant as well, although it’s not always obvious organizations get additional velocity benefits from deepening their involvement in open source. 

Let’s start with the advantages of contributing back bug fixes and new features for projects that your organization uses on a regular basis. First of all, the fact that your organization contributes back to your bug fixes means that others in the community will be able to work on other issues, whether it is fixing other bugs or working on new development. If it’s a project that you use, the act of contributing the work you would need to do anyway back to the community pushes the project forward that much faster; multiplied by all the organizations who rely on the project it means that the project will move forward substantially faster. 

In addition, the act of contributing to the project deepens the team’s understanding of how the project works. GitLab has a program in place to encourage paying customers to contribute code to the open source project; they find that when customers do so, they end up taking advantage of GitLab more than they would otherwise. Becoming involved in the project and contributing back bug fixes has a similar effect with other projects. 

But there’s also the case of publishing internal software projects as open source projects. In some cases, this doesn’t accomplish much, because the project just sits on GitHub without attracting much attention from anyone. However, if you are able to build a community around an internal software project that’s published as open source, you’ll often be able to recruit others to help with the development – or to find projects that already exist and provide the same outcome, and join forces with those maintainers. 

 

### Relationships with others

One of the many things that make open source different from closed source software is that open source is fundamentally not just about building a software product, it is about building relationships between individuals and between organizations. 

The advantage for individuals is relatively obvious: The relationships they build while contributing to and/or publishing and maintaining an open source project as part of their day job can help them improve their own skills, build their network and lead to additional professional opportunities in the future. For the organizations they work for, collaborating with others, both those who work in similar fields and those who work in completely different fields, can provide benefits both related to the software project they are working on, and beyond as well. 

For organizations that aren’t competitors but who work in related industries, the relationships that are built through open source projects can lead to other opportunities for joint projects. This can turn into joint marketing efforts, products that are packaged together and other commercial opportunities that go far beyond the software project that originally brought the two companies together. 

These relationships also give your team members others to turn to when faced with a challenge they don’t know how to handle, whether it’s related directly to the open source project that brought them together or to some other challenge. 

Being involved in existing open source projects will certainly build peer-to-peer relationships between your team members and their counterparts at other companies; writing, publishing and maintaining your own open source projects gives your organization the opportunities to be the center of a community of interest that brings together a group of peers. It is also possible for two or more organizations to collaborate on writing, publishing and maintaining an open source project together. It’s more common for one organization to write the initial project and then recruit additional maintainers from other organizations, but both scenarios can create relationships between individuals and between organizations that lead to additional commercial and technical opportunities. 

### Recruitment

Does your organization have trouble recruiting engineers? Is the process of onboarding new engineers long and burdensome for everyone? Because if so, becoming more involved in open source is one of the best ways to recruit engineers; it also helps evaluate the skill level of engineers much more accurately than any code test, and can speed up the onboarding process dramatically. 

Whether you get involved in open source projects by contributing to existing projects or by publishing your own internal software as open source projects, the team members who manage the relationship with open source are going to develop relationships with others in the community. That can lead to additional commercial opportunities as discussed above, but it also means that there’s a ready pool of people who are already known to your engineers. Assuming, of course, that your organisation is a respected member of the community you are in, your company will also be a more attractive workplace than others. According to the Linux Foundation’s State of Open Source in 2025, 74% of the professionals surveyed think that being involved with open source makes the company more attractive for talent. 

In addition, if you recruit an engineer who works on an open source project that your team is also involved in, you are able to evaluate his or her skill level much more accurately than in a coding test. You’ll see their pull requests and you’ll see the issues they report. Just as importantly, you’ll be able to see how they interact with others in the community and their ability to collaborate with others in a healthy way. In other words, you’re able to dramatically de-risk your hiring decisions. From the perspective of the potential recruit, the exact same thing is true: they have much more information about your organization and the way you work than would be possible in any other situation. In other words, they are also able to derisk the decision to take a job with you. 

When it comes to onboarding, someone you know through an open source project you are both already involved in comes with the huge advantage of already being completely up to speed about at least one project that the organization works on. They can continue contributing to the project on day one. Just as importantly, your team is likely to have a good idea of the new recruit’s strengths and weaknesses even before they start, and can adjust the onboarding process accordingly. 

### Retention

Generally speaking, engineers want the ability to contribute to open source projects, and potentially create their own open source projects. If they are able to do so as part of their job, they are more likely to stay. In the Linux Foundation State of Global Open Source 2025 report, 78% of people surveyed said that being involved in open source makes the organization a better place to work. So while being involved in open source is likely to improve your team members overall skill level and will open up additional career opportunities for them, it will also increase their loyalty to the organization, because they know that not all organizations will allow them to continue their involvement in open source. 

Even if your internal software isn’t particularly cutting edge, or if your engineers aren’t particularly challenged by their day-to-day, your team can continue to develop their skills 

### Visibility 

Being involved in open source is an additional "marketing" channel that will increase your organization's visibility. When it comes to recruiting developers, this can be particularly important, as mentioned above. But recruiting is not the only reason your organization might want to increase its visibility; being involved in open source projects will help. 

The advantages of increased visibility are most obvious for companies that create and sell software. For this type of company, being involved in open source can directly lead to new customers, since their target customers are likely to be involved with open source projects and aware of which organization are involved as well. But even for non-software companies, for whom the software engineers are not necessarily the target market, a presence in open source will increase the organization's overall visibility. 

In addition, not all open source projects are primarily used by software engineers! Some open source projects are truly deep-tech, used only by programmers. But many others are industry-specific, with end users who are not technical. While getting involved with deep tech projects will increase an organization's visibility with programmers, getting invovled in industry-specific open source projects will increase the organization's profile in the specific industry they work in, among potential customers and potential partners.
