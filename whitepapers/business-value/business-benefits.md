# Business Benefits 

### Innovation

Even by just using open source projects, you’re able to take advantage of the experiences of a wide range of use cases, individuals and industries. When you become involved in open source projects and even publish your own, you’re able to more quickly see how a piece of software can be used in a variety of novel situations, and to get feedback on use cases and edge cases quickly. 

Open source projects have a much shorter feedback loop than closed-source projects. If you develop a piece of software primarily for internal use (ie, you are not a software vendor), the only feedback you’ll get is from users inside the company. As a result, you’ll likely miss a number of potential ways the software could be used, and you won’t see the situations where it could be used in different industries. 

### Improved engineering quality

One of the frequently cited advantages to becoming involved in open source is upskilling; in open source communities people mention the advantage of having many eyes examining the code for potential bugs, security or otherwise. Regardless, there is a psychological effect to knowing that your work will be visible to the entire world that tends to push engineers to write cleaner code. Multiplied over years of practice and over the entirety of your engineering team, this can amount to a significant improvement in engineering quality without any specific training. 

However, improvements to the engineering quality come from more than just the bright light shone on the codebase. Engaging with open source communities also gives engineers exposure to a wider range of experiences and a wider range of mentors. The number of people they will get feedback from is expanded, and as a result their skill level will improve. 

### Improved engineering velocity

There is no doubt that open source in general increases engineering velocity, even for those who are simply users of open source software without any additional involvement in the community. 

For engineering teams that become contributors or who publish and maintain their own projects, the velocity advantages can be significant as well, although it’s not always obvious organizations get additional velocity benefits from deepening their involvement in open source. 

Let’s start with the advantages of contributing back bug fixes and new features for projects that your organization uses on a regular basis. First of all, the fact that your organization contributes back to your bug fixes means that others in the community will be able to work on other issues, whether it is fixing other bugs or working on new development. If it’s a project that you use, the act of contributing the work you would need to do anyway back to the community pushes the project forward that much faster; multiplied by all the organizations who rely on the project it means that the project will move forward substantially faster. 

In addition, the act of contributing to the project deepens the team’s understanding of how the project works. GitLab has a program in place to encourage paying customers to contribute code to the open source project; they find that when customers do so, they end up taking advantage of GitLab more than they would otherwise. Becoming involved in the project and contributing back bug fixes has a similar effect with other projects. 

But there’s also the case of publishing internal software projects as open source projects. In some cases, this doesn’t accomplish much, because the project just sits on GitHub without attracting much attention from anyone. However, if you are able to build a community around an internal software project that’s published as open source, you’ll often be able to recruit others to help with the development – or to find projects that already exist and provide the same outcome, and join forces with those maintainers. 

 

### Relationships with others

One of the many things that make open source different from closed source software is that open source is fundamentally not just about building a software product, it is about building relationships between individuals and between organizations. 

The advantage for individuals is relatively obvious: The relationships they build while contributing to and/or publishing and maintaining an open source project as part of their day job can help them improve their own skills, build their network and lead to additional professional opportunities in the future. For the organizations they work for, collaborating with others, both those who work in similar fields and those who work in completely different fields, can provide benefits both related to the software project they are working on, and beyond as well. 

For organizations that aren’t competitors but who work in related industries, the relationships that are built through open source projects can lead to other opportunities for joint projects. This can turn into joint marketing efforts, products that are packaged together and other commercial opportunities that go far beyond the software project that originally brought the two companies together. 

These relationships also give your team members others to turn to when faced with a challenge they don’t know how to handle, whether it’s related directly to the open source project that brought them together or to some other challenge. 

Being involved in existing open source projects will certainly build peer-to-peer relationships between your team members and their counterparts at other companies; writing, publishing and maintaining your own open source projects gives your organization the opportunities to be the center of a community of interest that brings together a group of peers. It is also possible for two or more organizations to collaborate on writing, publishing and maintaining an open source project together. It’s more common for one organization to write the initial project and then recruit additional maintainers from other organizations, but both scenarios can create relationships between individuals and between organizations that lead to additional commercial and technical opportunities. 

### Recruitment

Does your organization have trouble recruiting engineers? Is the process of onboarding new engineers long and burdensome for everyone? Because if so, becoming more involved in open source is one of the best ways to recruit engineers; it also helps evaluate the skill level of engineers much more accurately than any code test, and can speed up the onboarding process dramatically. 

Whether you get involved in open source projects by contributing to existing projects or by publishing your own internal software as open source projects, the team members who manage the relationship with open source are going to develop relationships with others in the community. That can lead to additional commercial opportunities as discussed above, but it also means that there’s a ready pool of people who are already known to your engineers. Assuming, of course, that your organisation is a respected member of the community you are in, your company will also be a more attractive workplace than others. According to the Linux Foundation’s State of Open Source in 2025, 74% of the professionals surveyed think that being involved with open source makes the company more attractive for talent. 

In addition, if you recruit an engineer who works on an open source project that your team is also involved in, you are able to evaluate his or her skill level much more accurately than in a coding test. You’ll see their pull requests and you’ll see the issues they report. Just as importantly, you’ll be able to see how they interact with others in the community and their ability to collaborate with others in a healthy way. In other words, you’re able to dramatically de-risk your hiring decisions. From the perspective of the potential recruit, the exact same thing is true: they have much more information about your organization and the way you work than would be possible in any other situation. In other words, they are also able to derisk the decision to take a job with you. 

When it comes to onboarding, someone you know through an open source project you are both already involved in comes with the huge advantage of already being completely up to speed about at least one project that the organization works on. They can continue contributing to the project on day one. Just as importantly, your team is likely to have a good idea of the new recruit’s strengths and weaknesses even before they start, and can adjust the onboarding process accordingly. 

### Retention

Generally speaking, engineers want the ability to contribute to open source projects, and potentially create their own open source projects. If they are able to do so as part of their job, they are more likely to stay. In the Linux Foundation State of Global Open Source 2025 report, 78% of people surveyed said that being involved in open source makes the organization a better place to work. So while being involved in open source is likely to improve your team members overall skill level and will open up additional career opportunities for them, it will also increase their loyalty to the organization, because they know that not all organizations will allow them to continue their involvement in open source. 

Even if your internal software isn’t particularly cutting edge, or if your engineers aren’t particularly challenged by their day-to-day, your team can continue to develop their skills 

### Visibility 

Being involved in open source is an additional "marketing" channel that will increase your organization's visibility. When it comes to recruiting developers, this can be particularly important, as mentioned above. But recruiting is not the only reason your organization might want to increase its visibility; being involved in open source projects will help. 

The advantages of increased visibility are most obvious for companies that create and sell software. For this type of company, being involved in open source can directly lead to new customers, since their target customers are likely to be involved with open source projects and aware of which organization are involved as well. But even for non-software companies, for whom the software engineers are not necessarily the target market, a presence in open source will increase the organization's overall visibility. 

In addition, not all open source projects are primarily used by software engineers! Some open source projects are truly deep-tech, used only by programmers. But many others are industry-specific, with end users who are not technical. While getting involved with deep tech projects will increase an organization's visibility with programmers, getting invovled in industry-specific open source projects will increase the organization's profile in the specific industry they work in, among potential customers and potential partners. 

### Reputation

Participating in open source communities, even if it's your engineering team who is participating, can build the organization's reputation and brand. An organization that contributes to and/or maintains open source projects is able to showcase the quality of the engineering, which can help both with recruitment but also, for companies that sell software of any kind, in building trust among customers. 

The reputation benefits of being involved in open source go beyond just showcasing your in-house engineering skills, particularly if the organization is involved not just at the level of contributing code, but also is part of a project's maintainer team and a visible project supporter. Imagine your organization supports a security-related project, both by employing engineers who work on the project and also by providing financing and/or other support for the project. The fact that you are involved in the project will improve your organization's repuation as a company that cares about security and has the internal expertise to ensure the security of their software. If your customers and collaborators care about security, this improved reputation can directly help your company land deals and seal partnerships. 

There is, of course, a reputational risk from open source: It is always better to not do something at all than to do it poorly, and that is especially true when it comes to something as public as an open source project. If your code is sloppy, or if your team members behave badly towards others in the open source communities you're involved in, your organization will take a reputational hit. That is one of the reasons it is a good idea to have organizational policies related to open source -- if your engineering team is treating open source communities like the wild west, it could hurt the organization's reputation. 

### Trust

An element of your organization's reputation is trust. Contributing to open source projects, and creating and maintaining open source projects, will help your organization build trust throughout the ecosystem, with different types of stakeholders -- potential employees, current employees, investors, partners, customers. Assuming, of course, that you do it well. 

Being involved in open source builds trust in a couple different ways. First of all, there is transperancy. The more of your codebase that is available for partners, employees and customers to see for themselves, the more they can verify that your software does exactly what it says it does -- and nothing else. The fact that you are not asking people to trust you at all, but are giving them the possibility to check it out for themselves, builds trust over time as they see that you are not hiding anything. 

The second kind of trust you can build has to do with the way the company behaves in the open source ecosystems it is part of. Is it a productive member of the community? Does the company invest over the long term, or show up suddenly to make demands without investing in building a relationship with others in the project? Do people who work for your organization treat others in the open source ecosystem with respect? If your organization behaves well in open source communities, partners, employees and customers are more likely to trust that your organization will behave well in other situations as well. 

### New opportunities

Being involved in open source communities, whether by creating and maintaining a project or by becoming active contributors and community members in an existing project, can create additional business opportunities and potentially new revenue streams. 

The best example of this dynamic is [Backstage](https://backstage.io), the project developed originally by Spotify and donated to the CNCF in 2020. Spotify's primary business has nothing to do with developer portals or developer tools at all, but since Backstage's success Spotify has explored monetizing the open source project they originally developed internally to fix the pain points related to a fast-growing engineering team. [Spotify now offers enterprise support, a Backstage portal and several paid Backstage plugins.](https://backstage.spotify.com/partners/spotify/bundle/spotify-plugins-bundle/) Not every open source project is going to end up as a revenue stream, but software projects that start as internal tools, are open sourced and then eventually spun off into new divisions or new companies are not that rare. 

But ultimately getting involved in open source can lead to additional business opportunties and additional revenue streams, whether it is directly monetizing an open source project or through the partnerships that open source collaboration encourages. 

## Strategies for maximizing the business benefits of open source

While there are many potential benefits from getting involved in open source, they will not necessarily happen just because you've published a project on GitHub or because you've submitted a pull request to a project you depend on. An even more insidious problem is when an organization does in fact get benefits from its involvement in open source, but no one is really aware of what those benefits are or how much they are worth to the company. When that happens, it puts the organization's involvement in open source at risk, because business leaders are likely to cut it when budgets get tight. Then the business suffers, and no one really understands why. 

That's why it's important to be intentional about the organization's involvement in open source, and to communicate how the organization works with open source and what it expects to get out of that involvement. Organizations get the most out of open source when both engineering and business leaders understand why open source is important, and those strategic goals from open source are translated into concrete policies to guide individual employees' interactions with open source, from the policy on using open source anonymously to how and when to contribute to and/or publish and maintain your own open source project. 

### Audit your current open source involvement

If your organization currently develops software, it almost certainly has some sort of involvement in open source already. So the first step to maximizing the business benefits you get from open source is figuring out what that involvement looks like. In surveys of open source usage, both business and engineering leaders dramatically underestimate open source usage in their organization, often because engineers consider open source so critical to their work that they take it for granted and don't discuss it with their leadership. 

Of course, there are other reasons to audit your involvement in open source! First of all, simply understanding which projects you use is important for security reasons; it's an important element of your software bill of materials (SBOM). But when it comes to open source projects, there's also the risk of a project being abandoned. When you audit your involvement in open source, you should try to evaluate the following: 

- Which projects do you have intregrated into your software stack?
- Which projects does your team use regularly?
- How critical is each project? If it were to go down, what would the impact on your organization be? How likely is it that you would be able to fix the problem internally? If the project goes down, would your customers be impacted at as well? 
- Which projects are your employees involved in, above and beyond using the project anonymously, if any?
- If there are projects your employees are involved in, what does that involvement look like? What pushed them to get involved?
- Are there any projects that your company has published as open source projects? Who published them? Are they being maintained? Who owns the projects?

In most organizations that have an established engineering department but little or no official open source governance, it's likely that even engineering leaders only see the tip of the iceberg when it comes to involvement in open source. So taking the time to fully evaluate what that involvement 

### Evaluate what you're getting out of open source right now

For open source champions, one of the biggest sources of frustration when talking with their colleagues, particularly those outside the engineering department, is that they often have a hard time articulating exactly what the company gets out of open source. This happens because while there are typical ways that an organization can benefit from involvement in open source, each organization is unique. It's important for open source champions to be able to make a clear case to business stakeholders about what the organization gets out of open source right now before they can argue for deeper involvement in open source projects. 

The challenge is that benefits from open source are often -- but not always -- indirect. But the larger risk is that companies who don't recognize the benefits they are already getting from open source will cut back on their involvement in open source, thinking that there's no ROI, but then notice a decline in reputation, visibility or ability to recruit that they can't explain. 

Once you've done a complete audit of what the organization's current involvement in open source looks like, you can start evaluating what that involvement is doing for the organization. It might not be immediately clear what you're getting from open source! In that case, the best course of action is to establish hypothesis for how open source is benefiting the business, and test those hypothesis. 

### Establish a maximum of three strategic goals you want from open source

### Create a written open source policy

### Measure your success (or lack thereof) 

### Get involved in the projects that are strategically important  

### Publish projects strategically
