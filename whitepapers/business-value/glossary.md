But there are many types of contributions to open source projects. They can come in the form of writing documentation, translating documentation or responding to questions in the community.
- Maintainer: The person or people who control the open source project's direction, have write access over the code-base, can accept (or reject) pull requests and decide what features to prioritize. Project maintainers have the ultimate control over what happens in a project!
