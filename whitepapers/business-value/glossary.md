# Glossary of Open Source Terms
This file is meant to both define terms that are commonly used in the open source world, as well as a brief description of how they relate to the business world. In some cases, you'll frequently encounter acronyms instead of the full term -- in those cases, the acronym is provided as well. 

# Terms

- Open Source (OS): Software that is published under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
- Open Source Program Office (OSPO): A dedicated team inside an organization that is responsible for setting policies and strategy to govern the organization's relationship with open source.
- Pull request (PR): A request to change or add a file to a repository in a code collaboration platform, usually GitHub or GitLab. Submitting a pull request is a way to request a review from a project maintainer, who can then decide to either reject or accept the change. 
- Open Source Project: Open source software is often referred to as a 'project.' 
- Repository: The 'file' in the code collaboration platform like GitHub or GitLab that contains all the files associated with a specific project. 
- User: Someone who uses the open source software! The vast majority of users of open source software are completely anonymous; one of the challenges in open source software is that maintainers of the software have so little information about who is using the software. 
- Contributor: Someone who contributes something tangible to an open source project. In most cases this refers to code contributors, or people who contribute code to the project. But there are many types of contributions to open source projects. They can come in the form of writing documentation, translating documentation or responding to questions in the community.
- Maintainer: The person or people who control the open source project's direction, have write access over the code-base, can accept (or reject) pull requests and decide what features to prioritize. Project maintainers have the ultimate control over what happens in a project! 
- License: The legal conditions under which a software product can be used. There are many types of software licenses. They stipulate how, and by whom, the software can be used. An open source license doesn't mean complete freedom to do whatever you want with the code, there are still certain conditions that have to be met in order to be in compliance with the license. 
- Steering committee:
- Working group:
- Free software: Free software is, generally speaking, software that is even more free than open source software. Users should have absolute freedom to do whatever they want with the software. Free software is considered the philosophy behind open source, whereas open source is an attempt to operationalize the ideas behind free software. 
- Copyleft license: A type of open source license that gives users somewhat fewer rights. The most noteable difference between a permissive and a copyleft license is that under copyleft licenses, users have to distribute any derivative works under the same license, and can't develop paid products from the source code. When the company behind an open source project is trying to monetize their project, this can protect them from competitors taking their source code and creating a directly competing product. However, it can also create problems for enterprises that need to incorporate open source code into their own software products. 
- Permissive license: A type of open source license that gives users broad rights to use, change, distribute and even create competing software products with the code. The most common permissive open source licenses are MIT and BSD licenses. 
- Contributor agreement: A legal agreement that contributors, particularly code contributors, sign before their contributions are accepted. Contributor agreements often cover things like copyright assignment and licensing; they can become extremely important if the project's license is ever changed. Contributor agreements are also critical if there is a plan for monetizing the project. It's a good practice to put in place a contributor agreement before accepting contributions from anyone. 
- Documentation: The "user manual" for software. Documentation is the text, illustrations and even videos that enable users to successfully install and use the open source software. Not all projects have documentation! But including documentation with open source projects is a best practice. 
- Roadmap: The plan for the future of the project. This can be as basic as a list of new features and functionality to add in the future, it can be as complex as a strategic document outlining the project's vision for the future, target user community, value proposition and more. Regardless, the roadmap should guide the direction that the project takes in the future. 
- Issue: An issue on GitHub is a way to make comments, report bugs, make suggestions and otherwise discuss with other users of an open source project on GitHub. 
- Community: The people who use and are engaged with an open source project. In the open source world, the word community is thrown around a lot, often in a way that is not very specific. In the romaticized vision of open source software, every open source project has an engaged group of volunteers and an a large number of people who are personally invested in the project's success. In reality, not every open source project will have an engaged community.
- Community edition: In open core companies, the 'community edition' generally refers to the open source project. 
- Open core: A model for monetizing an open source project in which there is a paid software product based on the open source project that is released under a commercial license. The 'core' of the software is open source, but there is additional functionality that isn't. 
- Commercial open source:
- License change:
- Business source license / fair source: 

# The Acronyms
- OS - Open Source.
- OSPO(s) - Open Source Program Office(s).
- .Md - Mark Down File.
- PR - Pull Requests. 
- SC - Steering Committee.
- WG - Working Group. 
- CFP - Call for Proposal. 

# Concepts 
- Pull Requests - This is a way of asking someone most likely a reviewer to look at your proposed changes and approve (merge) or decline. 
- Steering Committee - These are group of people that serve as the regulating body for an Open Source Community or Project activities. They are also referred to as a Board in many Communities but in TODO they are refered to as the steering Committe.
- Call for Proposal - This is a method where conference, meet ups and various programs issue a request (call) publicly for people to send in proposals to either speak or present a topic in their event.
