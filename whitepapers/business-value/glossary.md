# The Glossary for you!
This file will serve as a reference guide to assist non-technical managers to understand key terms, concepts, and acronyms related to open source in business environments.

# Terms

- Open Source (OS): Software that is published under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
- Open Source Program Office (OSPO): A dedicated team inside an organization that is responsible for setting policies and strategy to govern the organization's relationship with open source.
- Pull request (PR): A request to change or add a file to a repository in a code collaboration platform, usually GitHub or GitLab. Submitting a pull request is a way to request a review from a project maintainer, who can then decide to either reject or accept the change. 
- Open Source Project: Open source software is often referred to as a 'project.' 
- Repository: The 
- User: Someone who uses the open source software! The vast majority of users of open source software are completely anonymous; one of the challenges in open source software is that maintainers of the software have so little information about who is using the software. 
- Contributor: Someone who contributes something tangible to an open source project. In most cases this refers to code contributors, or people who contribute code to the project. But there are many types of contributions to open source projects. They can come in the form of writing documentation, translating documentation or responding to questions in the community.
- Maintainer: The person or people who control the open source project's direction, have write access over the code-base, can accept (or reject) pull requests and decide what features to prioritize. Project maintainers have the ultimate control over what happens in a project! 
- License: The legal conditions under which a software product can be used. There are many types of software licenses. They stipulate how, and by whom, the software can be used. An open source license doesn't mean complete freedom to do whatever you want with the code, there are still certain conditions that have to be met in order to be in compliance with the license. 
- Steering committee:
- Working group:
- Free software:
- Copyleft license: A type of open source license that gives users somewhat fewer rights. The most noteable difference between a permissive and a copyleft license is that under copyleft licenses, users have to distribute any derivative works under the same license, and can't develop paid products from the source code. When the company behind an open source project is trying to monetize their project, this can protect them from competitors taking their source code and creating a directly competing product. However, it can also create problems for enterprises that need to incorporate open source code into their own software products. 
- Permissive license: A type of open source license that gives users broad rights to use, change, distribute and even create competing software products with the code. The most common permissive open source licenses are MIT and BSD licenses.

- Roadmap:

# Concepts 
- Pull Requests - This is a way of asking someone most likely a reviewer to look at your proposed changes and approve (merge) or decline. 
- Steering Committee - These are group of people that serve as the regulating body for an Open Source Community or Project activities. They are also referred to as a Board in many Communities but in TODO they are refered to as the steering Committe.
- Call for Proposal - This is a method where conference, meet ups and various programs issue a request (call) publicly for people to send in proposals to either speak or present a topic in their event.
