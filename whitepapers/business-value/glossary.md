# Preamble
There is the engineering driven and the business driven side. The engineering driven side is typically already well represented in the Open Source community but for the business driven side we miss useful material.
Therefore we collaborate on the “Open Source in business guide” and we want to convince business people, that they should consider Open Source as an additional strategic tool in their strategy toolbox. Additionally we want to enable the Open Source evangelists in the organizations to convince their business managers about considering Open Source as an alternative to classic approaches by providing them some good practices an material that can be re-used.

The risk perspective is important but not a primary goal of the business guide (This better fits in the OpenChain community or other TODO group OSPO guides).
Nevertheless the risks shall be listed in a sober and self-evident manner and show that they are manageable and that there are even ISO-standards in place to handle them “safe and boring” (yearly motto in OpenChain in 2023).
On the other side, this handling does not come for free, but requires a certain invest in the necessary processes.
