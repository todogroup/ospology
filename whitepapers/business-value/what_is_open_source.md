## What is open source? 

When it comes to open source, there are a lot of misconceptions – even among software engineers. So what exactly is open source? 

Open source software is software that can be freely used, shared and modified. The philosophy behind open source software has its roots in the free software movement and hacker culture of the 1970s; the free software movement believes that software should be freely available to users. The 'free' in free software refers to freedom, and the movement is based on the four freedoms of software. They are: 

0. Run the software whereever you want, for whatever purpose
1. The ability to study and modify the source code
2. The abilty to give away or sell the software
3. The ability to give away or sell modified version of the software

Open source software has its roots in the free software movement, but it is a less extreme, less 'free' version. The organization in charge of translating the philosophy of open source software into concrete legal terms is the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org), also known as OSI. All software is released under a software license, and the OSI determines which licenses are open source licenses. You can see the list of OSI-approved licences [here](https://opensource.org/licenses). 

Open source software is simply software that is released under an OSI-approved license. 

It can be published anywhere, it can be created and maintained by volunteers or employees at AWS, it can be used for good and it can be used for evil. It can be produced by a single individual or a group, it can be a product of collaboration between multiple companies or it can be created entirely by a single company. 

If the software is published under an OSI-approved license, it is open source software. Conversely, software that is not published under an OSI-approved license is not open source. 

The above point is important, because there are actors in the ecosystem that have tried to muddy the definition of open source, or have tried to position open source as a spectrum. Open source is not a spectrum; either a piece of software has an OSI-approved license or it does not. 

The criteria that Open Source Initiative uses to determine whether or not a license will be approved are: 

	1.	Free redistribution. 
	2.	Availability of source code.
	3	Freedom to create derivative works 
	4.	No discrimination against people or groups 
	5.	No discrimination against use cases 

You can see the full description of the criteria [OSI uses here](https://opensource.org/osd).

Some of these clauses seem straightforward at first glance but in fact are not. For example, open source software can’t be restricted to use cases that the program author considers ‘good.’ An open source software can be used as part of a spyware or cyber warfare stack for any enemy state; it can be used in weapons technology. Open source software can be used by the software author’s commercial competitors. It’s possible to limit who contributes to the software because contributions require approval from a maintainer, but it is not possible to limit who uses and benefits from the software. 

### Legally open source versus culturally open source 

Much of the confusion around what is and is not open source comes down to the fact that while open source has a legal definition, there is a larger philosophy and culture around open source. There are also a set of common practices related to open source software that are described below. It’s important to note that while these practices are strongly associated with open source, they do not define a piece of software as open source. For example, just because code is available publicly on GitHub does not mean that it is open source code; there are many non-open-source licenses in which the code is public but published under a license that does not meet the OSI’s criteria for an open source licence.
