### Motivation

While the engineering-driven approach to open source is well-covered,a business-driven approach is less discussed but crucial for organizations to understand how open source can drive both innovation and financial value.
This initiative was initiated as part of the TODO Group’s Touchpoint calls to create a guide to address the gap in knowledge and strategic guidance around open source adoption from a business-driven perspective.

### Key Areas to explore:

1.	Provide businesses with tools to integrate open source into their core strategy.
2.	Help non-software-native companies (e.g., hardware or manufacturing) understand how open source can play a role in their business models.
3.	Educate business managers on the long-term investments required for successful open source strategies (e.g., building and nurturing open source communities).
