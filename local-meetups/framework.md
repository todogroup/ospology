## About OSPOlogy 
OSPOlogy is an initiative under the TODO group that offers best practice-sharing online workshops that are open to all, from folks starting their OSPOs to seasoned OPSOers! These sessions are typically led by a TODO member covering one topic or sharing their organization’s OSPO journey.
For further details see https://github.com/todogroup/ospology.

## Problem statement
TODO Group members requested local events to find and network with OSPOers near their area, to different OSPO topics.
Introducing OSPOlogy Meetups, powered by TODO Group.

We are introducing a new framework for in-person local meetups. OSPO Local Meetups aim to provide a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management within specific regions.

## Introducing Local OSPO Meetups powered by TODO Group

We are introducing a new framework for in-person local meetups. TODO Local Meetups aim to provide a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management within specific regions.

* Provides a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management

### Meetup Expectations

OSPO Local meetups powered by the TODO Group is committed to vendor neutrality and aims to become a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experiences on OSPOs. Even though we understand that during a conversation, OSPO tooling and/or services examples might arise, **vendor pitches must not be part of the meetup core discussions**.
