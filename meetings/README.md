## OSPOlogy Touchpoints

TODO Touchpoints are collaborative sessions designed to foster a safe and open environment for the community to share experiences and explore best practices in open source program management. These sessions also explore its impact and relationship with cross-disciplinary themes, including security, AI infrastructure, compliance, community health, business strategy, and more.  

Each Touchpoint features a presentation by professionals with experience or a direct connection to open source management or OSPOs, followed by an open discussion under Chatham House Rules to encourage the exchange of ideas among attendees.  

Presentations can take various forms, such as:  
- A slide deck previously presented at a conference  
- A new tool or initiative your team is developing and would like feedback on  
- A hot topic or challenge aimed at sparking meaningful conversation  

## Format

Touchpoints are offered in two different timeframes to ensure geographic availability:  
- **APAC & EMEA Touchpoints**: Thursdays, 12:00 PM GMT  
- **AMER & EMEA Touchpoints**: Mondays, 5:00 PM GMT  

Exact dates are flexible and depend on guest availability. However, we aim to organize at least one session per month for each geographic meeting.  

### Sessions can include:  

- **OSPO News**: A list of articles highlighting trends and best practices in open source management for organizations
- **Guest Presentation**: A session led by an invited speaker(s)
- **Working Group Updates**: Updates provided by working group chairs
- **Open Forum and Q&A**: A discussion and question-and-answer session held under Chatham House Rules

During the open forum, we strive to ensure that at least one member of the Steering Committee—composed of experienced open source managers from various organizations—joins to participate and moderate the discussion.  


## Planning

We maintain a folder listing all in-progress and confirmed sessions [here](). Additionally, confirmed sessions are shared in [TODO Group Community Calendar](https://todogroup.org/community/meetings/)  

> If you are interested in presenting at a touchpoint, please email `steering-committee (at) todogroup.org` to lock in your session details, providing a short title and description and desired day and time to present

## Coming Soon - Program Committee

The Steering Committee is exploring options to officially establish a dedicated committee under TODO to oversee Touchpoint program planning and moderation. If you are interested in being part of the PC, you can contact `streering-committee (at) todogorup.org` for more information.
