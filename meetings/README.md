## What are OSPOlogy Monthly Meetings?

OSPOlogy community meetings are public monthly meetings of the TODO Group and wider OSPO community, everyone is welcome to attend and participate.
The community is welcome to participate in the several activities of the planning process:

* Present research studies and/ or whitepapers to the community 
* Present a proposal for a potential research or whitepaper
