## TODO APAC Sync meetings

TODO APAC Sync meetings were created with the aim of working together to improve OSPO adoption and education within the different APAC regions 
and discuss with the broader community the challenges these organizations face when implementing an open source program or a similar initiative, 
following the Chatham House Rules
