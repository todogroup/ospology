# Open Source Sustainability Challenge in European organizations with an OSPO


## Context

When it comes to OSS wihtin organizations, sustainability can be seen as an ongoing challenge as the organization adapts 
to changes on its transition to open source adoption. We can find three main scopes when refereing to sustainability:

1. Informing current and future contirbutors in teh organization and involved teams of the evolving open source strategy, 
with updates on new developments and changes in real time.

2. Ensuring continued involvement in open source projects and initiatives to make use of any momentum that preceded a period 
of disruption or changes in the organizational environment.

3. Ensuring continued financial and executive support and providing
adequate resources to support the open source program. The executive sponsor is critical to continuity and communicating
the value of the open source efforts and expectations across the organization to encourage the successful adoption, implementation, and 
contribution to open source projects.

## Problem

OSPOs has been proved to be key lever to ensure open source sustainability within organizations in the long term. However, the way to proceed and operate 
is different depending on the type or organization (publi vs private) goals, values and region (e.g european regulations, country regulations).

How can Open Source (Program) Offices managers, leaders and teams operate within european frameworks to better achieve open source sustainability?

## Goal

During 2023, OSPOlogy Europe Sync calls Discussions aim to gravitate around the sustainability topic. 
The main goal is to identify and document a wide variety of OSPO patters for different European use cases, so OSPO leaders can better communicate the value 
of building a formalized entity around open source strategy in all organization levels.

* Meeting Notes would be shared by the assigned scribe via OSPOlogy GH Discussions at the end of each sync call to keep track of the progress.
