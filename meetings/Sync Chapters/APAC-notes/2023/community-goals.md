# Community Goals

During the January & February OSPOlogy APAC calls, the OSPOlogy APAC Community defined and agreed to work on the following community goals 
to help the OSPO adoption in APAC-based organizations:

* [1] üå± Assess how the OSPO financial and executive support in Asia and Oceania works, and share best practices to improve its sustainability and impact in organizations.
* [2] üìà Identify key metrics for measuring the business value of open source software based on the CHAOSS OSPO Working Group.
* [3] ü§ù Share use cases that demonstrate how OSPOs in Asia and Oceania can collaborate with specific types of stakeholders (e.g., developers, policymakers, and managers).
* [4] üåè Ease the creation of OSPO local communities and OSPO Ambassadors in Asia and Oceania (e.g [OSPO Local Meetup Japan](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospo-local-meetup-japan-japanese-speaking/))
* [5] üë©‚Äçüè´ Provide guidance and resources to help OSPOs in Asia and Oceania comply with open source best practices and contribute responsibly to open source projects.

These goals will shape the discussions, pesentations and materials shared during the monthly OSPOlogy APAC meeting and should serve as 
reference for OSPOlogy APAC moderators when designing the meeting topics and agenda.

### Focus Areas - How to Achieve Them

These goals can be achieved in different ways. Here are some potential outcomes that can come from these calls:

* Creating artifacts to help drive awareness of the need to build OSPOs and communicate their value [1, 2, 3].
* Interpreting metrics models in organizations from Asia and Oceania (from OSPO WG in CHAOSS) [1, 2, 3].
* Creating best practice guides [1, 2, 3].
* Promoting OSPO local meetups and local ambassadors in communication channels [4].
* Facilitating communication between the regional community and the global community [4].
* Discussing the OSPOlogy APAC group and the work done at conferences [4].
* Defining anti-patterns that organizations in Asia and Oceania should avoid if they want to contribute responsibly to open source projects [5].


### Scope in 2023

We've noticed that most attendees from the OSPOlogy APAC community come from the enterprise world. However, we want to emphasize that we welcome 
participation from all organizations and encourage diverse perspectives and use cases. That said, we do expect to have about 80% of the conversations 
on enterprise OSPOs in Asia, while still leaving room for other topics to be discussed.
