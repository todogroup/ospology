# OSPO Book Writing Style Guide

This style guide collects best practices for authors who would like to contribute to the OSPO book.
Following these rules will help ensure your content is clear, consistent, and professional.

## General Advice

Assume that your audience is familiar with open source, but may not have in-depth knowledge of every aspect of it.
Remember that readers may come from any industry and that it is helpful to be clear in your writing.
Aim to write in a relaxed professional style which is neutral in tone.
The book is a resource for sharing collective information more than sharing individual opinions.
Remember that each reader has their own context and you should encourage them to take any advice as general and not specific.

## Planning Your Content

Check what the TODO group and OSPO Book goup has in mind for goals for your chapter.
Work on an outline before creating the content.
Review the other chapters to ensure that you build on the book's content and don't repeat it.

### Links

The book exists in both and online and printed format.
For this reason, we ask you not to use hyperlinks in the running text, but instead use a superscript number and related footnotes.
Give link URLs in full (absolute, not relative) in the footnotes.
Format these as clickable links in the markdown file.
Where content exists in both source code (for example on GitHub) and published content (for example on the TODO website), you should link to the published content.

### Sharing Pre-Existing Content

This book should not replicate an exact copy of content already available elsewhere.
If you know of a good resource that you want to include, you can write about it and link to it (as mentioned previously), and give advice on how to incorporate it into the advice given in your chapter.

### Diagrams

Diagrams are really helpful in explaining concepts.
Please look at the other diagrams in the book and create new diagrams as close to their style as possible.
It may be possible to have your diagram re-drawn to meet the book's visual style guide.
If the diagram has come from another source please check that its licence permits you to share it and give credit to the source.

## Headings and Structure

### Heading Style

Use title-style capitalization for headings.
Capitalize every word except minor words like "a", "and", "at", and so on.

### Heading Punctuation

Don't put a period at the end of a heading.

## Sentence Structure

### Active Voice

In general, use active voice instead of passive voice.
Look for forms of "to be" (am, are, is, was, were, etc.) followed by a past participle.
When you use the active voice, you have to be more specific about who is doing the action.
This makes it more suitable for clear communication.

For example:

- Instead of "The document was saved by the user"
- Use "The user saved the document"

### Number Ranges

Don't add words such as "from" or "between" to describe a range of numbers.
Use a hyphen.

- Don't use "from 10-20 people" or "between 10-20 people"
- Do use "10-20 people"

### Accessibility Considerations

You should write in a way that is easy to understand.
Some people do not speak English as a first language.
Some people have learning difficulties.
When you write try to use sentences that are shorter rather than longer.
Use the most common words and say what you mean.
Even people who can read well find clear writing easier to understand.

## Word Choice and Terminology

### Avoid Latin Abbreviations

- Use "for example" instead of "e.g." or "eg"
- Use "that is" instead of "i.e." or "ie"
- Use "and so on" instead of "etc." or "etc."
- Use "NOTE:" instead of "NB"

### Use Inclusive Language

Avoid gender-specific terms when gender-neutral alternatives exist, for example:

- Use "graduate" instead of "alumna" or "alumnus"
- Use "strong enough" instead of "man enough"
- Use "human kind" or "humanity" instead of "mankind"
- Use "manufactured" instead of "manmade"
- Use "personnel" instead of "manpower"
- Use "intermediary" instead of "middleman/middlemen" or "middlewoman/middlewomen"
- Use "upstaging" instead of "oneupmanship"
- Use "technician(s)" instead of "repairman/repairmen" or "repairwoman/repairwomen"
- Use "salesperson" or "sales people" instead of "salesman/salesmen" or "saleswoman/saleswomen"

Don't use these as gender-neutral pronouns:

- he/she
- s/he
- (s)he

### Avoid Spatial References

Consider users who may be using screen readers and cannot see the spatial relationship between items on the screen or page.

- Use "preceding" instead of "above" or "left"
- Use "following" instead of "below" or "right"

### Avoid First-Person

Try to avoid first-person pronouns and phrases:

Avoid plurals:

- "we"
- "we've"
- "we're"
- "our"
- "ours"
- "us"
- "let's"

Avoid singular:

- "I"
- "I'm"
- "me"
- "my"
- "mine"

### Avoid Internet Slang

Don't use internet slang abbreviations such as:

- "tl;dr"
- "ymmv"
- "rtfm"
- "imo"
- "fwiw"

### Use American Spelling

In general, use American spelling instead of British or other variants:

- Avoid words ending in "-ise" or "-nise" (use "-ize" or "-nize" instead)
- Use "color" instead of "colour"
- Use "labor" instead of "labour"
- Use "center" instead of "centre"

### Avoid Future Tense

Avoid using "will" when possible.
Use present tense where appropriate.

### Use Contractions

Use contractions to make your writing more conversational, for example:

- Use "can't" instead of "cannot"
- Use "don't" instead of "do not"
- Use "isn't" instead of "is not"
- Use "won't" instead of "will not"

## Formatting and Punctuation

### Number-Unit Spacing

Put a nonbreaking space between the number and the unit:

- For data measurements: B, kB, MB, GB, TB
- For time measurements: ns, ms, s, min, h, d

### Sentence Spacing

Use one space after periods, question marks, and exclamation points.
Don't use two spaces.

### Semicolons

Use semicolons judiciously.
Consider whether a period or a conjunction would work better.

### Quotation Marks

Commas and periods go inside quotation marks, not outside.

### Acronyms and Initialisms

Don't use periods with acronyms or initialisms (such as "U.S.A.").

Spell out unfamiliar acronyms on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses.
For example: "Integrated Development Environment (IDE)".

Common acronyms don't need to be spelled out, for example: FAQ, HTML, OSS, PDF, ZIP.

### Parentheses

Limit your use of parentheses.
Consider whether the information would work better as a separate sentence or phrase.

### Oxford Comma

Use the Oxford comma.
This is the comma before "and" or "or" in a series of three or more items.
Correct: "I like cats, dogs, and rabbits."
Incorrect: "I like cats, dogs and rabbits."

### Numbers and Ordinal Numbers

Spell out all numbers (one, two, three and so on) in text instead of using numerals (1, 2, 3 ans so on).
Once you get over ten, you can use numerals (11, 12, 13 and so on).
The same rule applies to ordinal numbers (first, second, third, and so on).

### Optional Plurals

Don't use plurals in parentheses such as "file(s)".
Choose either the singular or plural form.

### Slashes

Don't use slashes to show that there are two optional words.
Choose just one word, or use another word like "and" or "or" to show what you mean.

- Correct: "Share your updates with managers and leaders. "
- Incorrect: "Share your updates with managers/leaders. "

### Adverbs Ending in "-ly"

Words ending in "-ly" don't need a hyphen when they modify another word:

- Use "highly configurable system" instead of "highly-configurable system"

### Em Dashes

Do use a space before or after a dash.

- Incorrect: "The project—a collaborative effort—was completed ahead of schedule."
- Correct: "The project — a collaborative effort — was completed ahead of schedule."

### Ellipses

In general, don't use an ellipsis (...) unless indicating missing text in a quote.

### Exclamation Points

Don't use exclamation points in text.

### Colons

Text that follows a colon should be in lowercase, unless it's a proper noun or acronym.

### Date Format

Use the  ISO 8601 date format (for example, YYYY-MM-DD), not:

- 31.07.2016 or 31/07/2016 or 31 July 2016, or July 31, 2016.

### Time Format

Use "AM" or "PM" (preceded by a space) for time references:

- Correct: "10 AM" or "2 PM"
- Incorrect: "10AM", "10am", "10a.m.", or "10 a.m."

### Glossary of Preferred Terms

Replace these terms:

- Use "or" or "also known as" instead of "a.k.a" or "aka"
- Use "OK" instead of "okay", "ok" or "Okay"
- Use "app" instead of "application"
- Use "approximately" instead of "approx."
- Use "checkbox" instead of "check box"
- Use "data is" instead of "data are"
- Use "less data" instead of "fewer data"
- Use "to" instead of "in order to"
- Use "open source" instead of "open-source"
- Use "open source" instead of "OS"
- Use "OSS" instead of "open source software"
- Use "versus" instead of "vs."
- Use "web" instead of "World Wide Web"
