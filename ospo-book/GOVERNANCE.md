# Project Governance


## Contributor Ladder

Hi there! üëã Thanks for your interest in contributing to the OSPO Book project. Whether you contribute to new chapters, review existing PRs, include new book terms in the [glossary.md](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/chapters/glossary.md), or make translations into your native language, there are many ways to become an active member of this community. This doc outlines the different contributor roles within the project and the responsibilities and privileges that come with them.

### 1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Observers

The OSPO Book Project is for everyone. Anyone can join the [public mailing list](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/WG-ospo-book-project/messages), ask questions and propose ideas for the community to discuss by opening an issue.

### 2. üßë‚Äçüíª Contributors

[Anyone can become a contributor](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/AUTHORS.md#co-authors) simply by contributing to the project. All contributors are expected to follow the TODO Code of Conduct.

There are a variety of ways you can contribute to the project, including:

* Content contributors: everyone who improves existing chapters under review or initiates the baseline for a new one.
* Technical contributors: everyone who enhances the repository's infrastructure to enable the generation of automatic PDF versions for the chapters.
* Localization contributors: those who help translate the OSPO book into another language. (We recommend to wait until the first release is published).
* Interviewees: anyone who participates in the [OSPO book interviews](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/docs/interview-questionnaire.md) to feature use cases and include quotes on open source best practices within organizations.

Contributors can have multiple roles or focus on one area only. All these contributions are equally important and help foster a thriving community.

Content contributors are expected to:

* Review Chapter PRs for accurate information within a specific topic
* Review issues and provide feedback and guide them when needed
* Attend Contributors's calls at least two times per year (invites are sent via [OSPO Book Mailing List](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/ospo-book-project))

### 3. üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Maintainers

Maintainers can also merge PRs. Anyone can become a OSPOlogy maintainer by meeting the requirements included at [OSPOlogy governance document](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#ospology-repo-governance)

If a maintainer is no longer interested in or cannot perform the duties, they should move themselves to emeritus status.

To become a maintainer, start by expressing interest to existing maintainers. Existing maintainers will then ask you to demonstrate the qualifications above by contributing PRs, doing reviews, and doing other such tasks under their guidance. After some time of working together, maintainers will decide whether to grant maintainer status. This decision will be based on demonstrated level of proficiency and responsiveness.

### Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when a contributor's commitment levels change, they can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs. moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

### Stepping Back Into a Role

If and when someone is available to step back into a previous contributor role, project leadership can consider and arrange this.
