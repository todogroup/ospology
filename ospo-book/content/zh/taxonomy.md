Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) can be complex and diverse, depending on various factors such as their nature, organizational culture, goals, and size. To help readers quickly identify which sections of the book are most relevant to their interests, each chapter follows a consistent structure and includes the following deliverables: General Content, Assessment Checklists, OSPO Anti-Patterns, and *Continue Here* Resources. Additionally, throughout the chapters, readers will find concrete sections tagged with *segment tags*, which are explained below.

## 🔖 细分标签

The tag system followed in the book aims to show the types of segments that the content is most relevant to. These segments are organized within `organizational goals` & `drivers of motivators` that has direct impact on the creation, evolution of the different OSPO roles and its perceived value to the organization.

**目标对齐定义：**
Goal alignment refers to the process of aligning the goals and objectives of the OSPO
with the overall mission and purpose of the organization and those entities that shapes
the organization (e.g government laws).

**动机因子定义：**
Motivation is the driving force that fuels people and entities to achieve their goals and
reach their full potential.

### 识别最佳细分部分的常见问题

Answering questions such as "What does my organization do?", "What are the mission and values of my organization?", "How is my organization structured?", "What is my organization trying to achieve with open source?", "Why are they investing in open source?", and "Is open source already being used, and if so, how?" can help readers identify the most relevant segment to their organization's nature. Chapter 1 provides a deeper exploration of open source readiness.

Regardless of the type of organization, it is essential for OSPO leaders and teams to understand the drivers of motivation for the actors they interact with and align their goals with the overall mission of the organization.
