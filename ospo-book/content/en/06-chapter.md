## Introduction

> NOTE: This chapter has been developed through the collective expertise of CHAOSS open source project and participants from the CHAOSS OSPO Metrics Working Group, with support from the TODO Group.

Metrics are an important part of any modern organization. When used effectively, they offer a valuable way to track the impact of your team and its projects. For an OSPO, metrics not only support planning and measuring the impact of its work — they also provide deeper insight into the open source projects the organization depends on.

In the past, it might have been acceptable to know little about key open source projects. But that’s no longer a sustainable approach as the regulatory and security landscape around open source continues to evolve. As we deepen our understanding of the open source projects that matter to us, community metrics become essential tools. In this chapter, we’ll explore how to place those metrics in context and how, together, they can offer better insights to guide strategic decisions across an organization.

There are several reasons why organizations need visibility into open source projects. For example:
* The organization is using open source and wants to track contributions to key projects.
* The organization participates in an open source ecosystem and needs to identify potential risks and offer support where necessary.
* The organization wants to contribute to the sustainability of OSS — especially the software that’s critical to its business.
* The organization must stay compliant with upstream license requirements and respond to security issues that could affect operations.

### The Goal-Question-Metric Framework

Metrics for metrics' sake benefit no one. Consider these metrics:

* The average age of issues is 10.3 days.
* The total number of pull requests was 121 last month.
* We had 3 new companies join our community over the past 15 days.

Without context, these metrics provide no insight, so it's important to ensure that you use a framework like "goal-question-metric" to give you metrics that support your goals instead of working against them.

The CHAOSS project (Community Health Analytics for OSS) advocates for using the "goal-question-metric" because it's a structured method for deriving metrics that align with organizational goals. It involves three key steps:

#### Goals

Identify and understand your organizational goals. These can vary significantly but typically include objectives like recruiting talent or enhancing community engagement.

#### Questions

Break down these goals into specific, actionable questions. For example, to assess recruitment efforts, one might ask, “Who are important contributors?” or “How many did we help hire?”

#### Metrics

Develop metrics to answer these questions. Metrics should be operational and data-driven, such as the number of contributions by name, hiring successes, or project activity levels. Some good data points, like the number of commits (on a software project), may not be relevant to the question you need to answer.

### Understanding the  Role of Open Source Community Metrics

It's worth taking a moment to understand how open source community metrics support the other types of metrics that organizations are familiar with. Open source community metrics provide OSPOs with tangible ways to measure the influence, effectiveness, and strategic value of their open source initiatives.

By tracking contributions, engagement levels, and collaboration across projects, OSPOs can assess how well their organization is participating in and supporting the open source ecosystem.

These metrics help demonstrate the impact of open source work on broader business goals such as accelerating innovation, reducing development costs, attracting talent, and increasing product visibility. Metrics also provide insight into community health and sustainability, highlighting whether a project is gaining traction, fostering collaboration, and attracting active users and contributors.

By tying community metrics to organizational KPIs, OSPOs can showcase the value of open source beyond code, such as improved product feedback loops, faster time to market, stronger developer relations, and enhanced technical credibility. This playbook provides guidance for OSPOs to track, analyze, and communicate those metrics effectively, translating open source participation into measurable business impact.

## Using Metrics to Communicate the Impact of Your OSPO

Metrics play an important role in communicating impact. Following the goal-question-metric approach here are four goals that OSPOs can consider, and questions to go with them.

### 1: Partner Impact

**Goal**

Understand how open source collaboration fosters strategic partnerships that can enhance market insight, strengthen vendor relationships, and create shared value beyond individual technologies.

**Commentary**

Open source project work is premised on collaboration, a collaboration that often involves unexpected partnerships. These partnerships are aimed at developing non-differentiating technologies that each partner needs, yet doesn't necessarily have the resources or inclination to produce alone. Open source projects bring together organization members to work together in the pursuit of shared problems and this proximity can result in benefits beyond any one shared open source technology. Improved open source partnerships can have positive secondary effects, including stronger ties with upstream vendors, improved understanding of market rival positions, and direct interaction with downstream users.

**Questions**

* What other companies are involved in our open source projects of interest?
* What other companies are involved in our pull requests?
* How are other companies involved in our pull requests?
* What's the composition of involved companies as our vendors, rivals, and customers?

**Metrics**

Consider what data is available to you to be able to answer these questions, and what other information you would need to feel confident in what it would mean to your goals if the number goes up or down.

### 2: Community Impact

**Goal**

Evaluate how employee engagement in open source communities reflects organizational support, strengthens individual skill development, and enhances the organization's presence and influence in key projects.

**Commentary**

There are ways that an organization can support community engagement by employees (for example contribution guidelines, intellectual property management, and license support). Support will often include why the community is important to your organization - including a time and prioritization component in how much time an employee spends in external/upstream work. companies can observe employees as good citizens for reasons of personal and organizational gain, and help employees understand their importance in bridging between the organization and the community.

**Questions**

* What percentage of employee contributions are merged?
* What percentage of employee issues are closed without conversation?
* How many of our employees have maintainer or leadership roles in key open source projects?
* Have upstream contributions helped modernize tech skills for employees?
* Which projects do our employees make over 50% of the contributions?

**Metrics**

Consider what data is available to you to be able to answer these questions, and what other information you would need to feel confident in what it would mean to your goals if the number goes up or down.

###  3: Ecosystem Impact

**Goal**

Monitor and contribute to the health and resilience of open source ecosystems to ensure long-term viability, reduce risk, and support the strategic sustainability of key dependencies.

**Commentary**

Working with open source is never easy as rival corporations may dominate upstream projects that your organization is interested in, upstream projects may unexpectedly change licenses, and contributor agreements, whether individual or organizational, can be complex to understand and adhere to. Clearly, such challenges can be overcome and often include strategic engagement with the projects your organization aims to benefit from. Open source ecosystems are economic and social systems comprising different companies, motivations, and requirements intended to support production and demands. In an effort to ensure the efficiency and durability of any open source ecosystem, companies must not only monitor the ecosystem's long-term viability but also engage within the ecosystem when problems are identified and stabilization is required.

**Questions**

* What percentage of our suppliers provide OSS bills of material?
* What's the long-term viability of the open source projects we rely on?
* What's the risk to the ecosystem if an open source project becomes unviable?

**Metrics**

Consider what data is available to you to be able to answer these questions, and what other information you would need to feel confident in what it would mean to your goals if the number goes up or down.

### 4: Organizational Impact

**Goal**

Align open source engagement with internal governance, security, and product development to maximize the value of open source within organizational strategy and operations.

**Commentary**

Engagement with open source communities includes working in the upstream to effectively use OSS in organizational products. In this, there is a need to monitor the intake of OSS for infosec, legal, and engineering reasons. Companies can establish software intake processes, working with teams to either technically track or socially consider issues related to open source intake. Organizational impact can also include working downstream with projects and companies that rely on your organizational products. This can include working to gain a clearer picture of  the open source that is in your shipped products. Organizations can work in securing and regulating their own internal open source processes in an effort to improve product development activities.

**Questions**

* What characteristics does an organization inspect related to inbound OSS?
* What product-level software and infrastructure contains OSS dependencies?
* How is OSPO strategy aligned with organizational strategy and departmental objectives?
* How often is OSPO strategy used to guide business decision making processes?
* How does the use of open source influence organizational value?

**Metrics**

Consider what data is available to you to be able to answer these questions, and what other information you would need to feel confident in what it would mean to your goals if the number goes up or down.

## If You Manage Open Source Projects

For organizations that create and manage their own open source projects, or are closely involved in managing them, there is a series of metric-related CHAOSS Practitioner Guides [^1]  to guide you through identifying the right metrics for a selection of use cases.

## If You Use Open Source Projects

For organizations that use open source projects and want to understand the health of these projects, the following information can help them consider what's right for them.

### How OSPOs Can Navigate the Complexities of Open Source Project Health

Understanding the health of an open source project is not a simple task. Open source health includes many different concerns—both technical and social—that can appear at the project level or across the broader ecosystem. A review of existing research identified 107 such concerns [^2]. To help make sense of this complexity, researchers worked with 17 experts from industry and the open source community to organize these concerns into a framework of 21 health aspects.

These health aspects focus on important areas such as:

* Community productivity and stability.
* Project orchestration and leadership.
* Production processes and outputs.

Each health aspect is further described using attributes—smaller, more detailed elements—that help organizations examine project health in a structured way.

#### Matching the Framework to the Right Context

The experts interviewed emphasized that organizations must consider the type and characteristics of each open source project they're analyzing. Not all projects are the same, and different traits may influence how to assess their health. Important factors to look at include:

* The life cycle stage of the project (for example early stage vs. mature).
* Its complexity (how big and technically demanding it is).
* The governance model (how decisions are made and who makes them).
* The strategic value the project holds for the organization

When comparing open source projects, OSPOs should group and assess projects with similar characteristics. Comparing very different types of projects can lead to misleading results [^3].

#### Making Smart Choices About What to Measure

Every organization has a different context—different markets, technologies, and risks. Because of this, there is no "one size fits all" approach to assessing open source health. OSPOs should:

* Decide which health aspects and attributes matter most based on their organization’s needs.
* Prioritize efforts — it's too time-consuming and expensive to measure everything.
* Focus on the data that provides the most useful insights for risk management and decision-making.

Instead of trying to measure everything at once, OSPOs should start small, learn from early efforts, and refine their approach over time. Health assessments work best when they're part of a practical and scalable process that evolves with experience.

### Case Study: How a Global Automotive Company Measures Open Source Project Health

#### A Practical Approach to Evaluating and Managing OSS Dependencies

In 2024, Linåker and colleagues worked with a large international automotive company to create a simple and effective way to assess the health of open source software (OSS) projects [^4]. Their case study shows how organizations can customize health checks to fit their needs and workflows.

#### Building a Health Assessment Process

The team started by talking to employees through interviews and focus groups. Based on these insights, they developed a short questionnaire and a process tailored to the company’s environment.

**Key features of the process:**

* Manual inspections at the intake stage using standardized checklists.
* Automated tool support used when helpful.
* Simple documentation to track findings for future reviews, follow-ups, and training.

The goal was to keep the process lightweight and efficient, while still capturing important health risks in open source projects.

#### Monitoring Projects Already in Use

The company also needed a way to track OSS projects already integrated into their systems. Because these projects often have many dependencies, manual checks weren't practical.

Their proposed solution:

* Use automated tools to run regular health checks.
* Customize tools based on the ecosystem and type of dependencies.
* Flag risky projects so developers or analysts can do deeper inspections when needed.

Tools from the CHAOSS community, such as GrimoireLab and Augur, provide a good starting point. The company can adapt them to match its internal needs.

#### Making Health Assessments Part of Daily Work

To make the new process successful, the recommendations from the team focused on training and team involvement:

* Hold workshops to introduce the checklists and tools.
* Schedule regular feedback sessions to review real OSS projects.
* Encourage discussion and knowledge-sharing across teams.

Over time, the company can make OSS health checks a normal part of its software development and quality assurance workflows.

#### What OSPOs Can Learn

This case offers useful lessons for OSPOs that want to reduce risk and improve long-term OSS reliability.

**Key takeaways:**

* Start simple with manual checklists and a clear intake process.
* Use automation for ongoing monitoring of large numbers of dependencies.
* Integrate health checks into existing workflows.
* Support the process with training, tools, and regular team discussions.

By identifying problems early and responding quickly, organizations can reduce risks and make sure their open source software remains secure, stable, and sustainable.
