## Introduction

OSPO day-to-day operations encompass a broad spectrum of activities aimed at enhancing open source engagement and compliance within the organization, including:

- **Direct Open Source Support:** Involves answering questions on all aspects of open source, including license compliance, selecting open source software, and interactions with vendors. It also includes engaging with the community and partners, securing sponsorships, and organizing open source events.
  
- **Automation Tools:** Creating process automation to support open source policies is important because policies alone may not always be effective. Managers know that their workers will not always follow policy and therefore want effective options to automate use, management, and tracking of open source components. Automation is useful in many areas of open source including license compliance and security.

- **Documentation, Training, and Education:** An OSPO can play a leading role in ensuring that individuals are qualified to assess open source projects for use in the organization and contribute to critical open source projects for the organization. Developing training materials and documentation and/or aiding teams to produce these across different departments are key tasks.

- **Resource Allocation:** There can be a lot of areas that an OSPO can offer value to an organization. Therefore, prioritizing work and allocating resources strategically and tactically is an important activity that will improve the OSPO's impact.

- **Risk Management:** OSPOs are well-placed to take a holistic view of the risk that the organization faces when using open source projects. It is useful for the OSPO to assess the risks by obtaining a comprehensive view of the organization's tech stack. This may include generating SBOMs which allow the OSPO to consider the risks in software from vendors, legacy software, and proprietary software as well as in open source. This is more about a business assessment perspective rather than just data gathering, as risk can only be managed, not eliminated. Optimizing SBOMs is about balancing risks against benefits.

- **Sponsoring Open Source Communities and Foundations:** Your organization depends on open source. The projects in open source are only as healthy as their communities, and you can invest your time and money in supporting communities either directly or through Foundations. These relationships need to be understood and managed with care to achieve outcomes that will benefit the projects and your organization. Sometimes money is not the best fix for a problem, and fostering a closer partnership and providing development, marketing, or programmatic support is more useful.

- **Measuring Technical Debt:** Providing knowledge on how to measure the technical debt on an open source project helps to determine the risks associated with the project and, when done in collaboration with the project community, is a form of educational advocacy to help projects improve and sustain themselves.

- **Coordinating with Various Parts of the Organization:** It can be helpful to check that you know all your stakeholders, and have the right amount of interaction with them. Take a look at the [OSPO flower diagram in Chapter 3](../03-chapter/#the-ospo-flower-diagram) for help mapping interactions.

- **Giving Advice on Open Source Consumption:** The OSPO considers both the strategic view on which open source projects to consume and on the best practice for using the selected projects. The OSPO should provide reference materials and guidance on how the company should select which open source projects it uses and how it manages them. Guidelines and policy can be purely technical or can include considerations based on open source project health and practices, like the [Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/specification/Secure_Supply_Chain_Consumption_Framework_(S2C2F).pdf).

## Daily Operations Using the OSPO MindMap and Activity Engagement Models

### Getting Started with OSPO MindMap

To get an overview of the potential activities of an OSPO we offer you the [OSPO Mind Map](https://todogroup.org/resources/mindmap/). The OSPO Mind Map outlines the main responsibilities, roles, behaviors, and team sizes within the ecosystem of an OSPO.

### OSPO MindMap Limitations

The contributors to this book have identified challenges in implementing the mind map, particularly in filtering responsibilities based on the organization's level of open source engagement. Because of this, the aim of this chapter is to provide an in-depth classification of these activities, grouped by levels of open source engagement. This book uses Ibrahim H.'s open source activity engagement model — previously seen in Chapter 2 — as it is relatively simple, and is not focused on corporate structures.

Each company has different aspects of open source compliance, interpretations of licenses and different risk appetite (e.g dealing with regulations). Having well-defined compliance rules and practices is the first step toward deterministic open source compliance                                                                                                                                               |
| Define rules and policies on using open source (criteria for using open source software which relate to open source health)                     | Consumption of open source projects is not just viewed through the compliance lens, but is considered more holistically and includes the risks associated with unhealthy projects. A consensus is built in the company related to the hygiene related to consumed open source components. The organization has clear policies to follow. | Consumed open source projects are lower in risk because they are healthy, fixing security vulnerabilities, implementing new features and release regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Define rules and policies on how to contribute to open source (criteria on how to engage in the community, how to transfer rights, Contributor License Agreements) | The OSPO can increase awareness of the two-way relationship with open source projects. Using policies supports a consistent and ethical approach. The organization has clear policies to follow.                                                                                                     | Policies and practices ensure that the organization considers how to jointly build value with open source projects.

External support for open source components can sometimes be bought from a vendor or a service provider. Alternatively, other options are to managed the support yourself with the help of the community (being realistic in considering what a community can be expected to support), or going with the risk of not having support which may be appropriate for scenarios where the risk is low. |

## Recommendations

### Scenario #10

Social Engineering Attack on Upstream xz/liblzma: A [social engineering attack targeted the xz/liblzma](https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline), an essential open source library. The attack was meticulously planned, gaining trust within the community before executing a malicious attack. This incident was discovered inadvertently by an unrelated project, underscoring the sophistication and stealthiness of such vulnerabilities. The challenge for OSPOs lies in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities, which are not always apparent until after they occur. Despite existing procedures and policies, OSPOs recognize the need for mechanisms to proactively measure and respond to such threats.

> Recommendation
>
> 1. SBOMs Compliance Ready: Ensure that all software components are documented through automatically generated Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). This documentation helps in quickly identifying potentially compromised components once a vulnerability is disclosed.
> 
> 2. Automation Security Checks: Implement automated security checks, such as the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev/), to continuously evaluate the security posture of projects. This proactive measure can highlight vulnerabilities or anomalies that merit further investigation.
> 
> 3. Having a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) within the organization and having the OSPO collaborate closely with them. This specialized team should be equipped with the tools and authority to respond swiftly to security incidents. Pre-existing relationships within the team facilitate rapid internal communication about the severity of incidents.
> 
> 4. Scorecard Management: Keep security and vulnerability scorecards up to date. These scorecards should reflect the latest security checks and assessments, helping in quick decision-making during a crisis.
> 
> 5. Automated Feedback Loops: Develop well-automated feedback loops for bug reporting and fixing. Knowing who is responsible for addressing a particular bug and ensuring that this process is as automated as possible can significantly reduce response times.

### Scenario #11

Licence changes on an Open Source project. OSPOs face the challenge of navigating license changes and assessing software trustworthiness. When [projects like Redis change their terms](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/22/redis_changes_license/) it can have significant implications for use, distribution, and contribution. OSPOs need to communicate these changes clearly and understand the roles and responsibilities dictated by new license terms. Furthermore, OSPOs are tasked with evaluating the trustworthiness of software, which can vary based on whether a project is maintained by a single vendor or hosted under a foundation. For instance, The [AlmaLinux OS Foundation](https://thenewstack.io/jack-aboutboul-how-almalinux-came-to-be-and-why-it-was-needed/) presents a case where donating a project to a foundation mitigated risks associated with single-vendor governance, thereby enhancing trust in the project.

> Recommendation
>
> 1. Educational Initiatives on License Implications: Develop educational materials and sessions for developers and users within the organization to understand the nuances of different licenses. This understanding will help them make informed decisions when using or contributing to open source projects.
>
> 2. Explicit License Terms: Work with legal teams to ensure that license terms are as explicit and unambiguous as possible. Clear terms help in avoiding misunderstandings and potential legal conflicts.
> 
> 3. Software Trust Rating System: Implement a system to evaluate and rate the trustworthiness of software, considering factors like governance structure, maintenance practices, and community engagement. Projects hosted under reputable foundations could be rated higher for trustworthiness due to the oversight and governance provided.
> 
> 4. Encourage Foundation Hosted Projects: Advocate for donating projects to foundations to mitigate risks associated with single-vendor control. Highlight successful cases like AlmaLinux to illustrate the benefits of this approach, such as increased trust and community support.
> 
> 5. Stakeholder Engagement in License Decisions: Engage a broad range of stakeholders, including developers, legal advisors, and end users, in discussions about license changes or the adoption of new projects. Their insights can help in making balanced decisions that align with the organization's values and risk tolerance
