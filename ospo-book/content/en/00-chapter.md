## What is This Book About?

Open source is a reality for all organizations that work with software — not just for software companies.  Because of this, actively managing open source is becoming increasingly important for many organizations.

One way to manage open source is by setting up an Open Source Program Office (OSPO). Many companies and organizations have adopted this approach, and there is now a lot of shared experience and knowledge about how to do it successfully. In the open source spirit, much of this knowledge is openly available in the community.

This book provides a clear introduction for anyone who wants to understand how OSPOs help organizations manage open source. It is also a helpful resource for people already working in OSPOs who want to strengthen their role in shaping and managing open source strategy and operations. The book offers practical advice on topics such as:

* Building an open source strategy.
* Setting up an OSPO.
* Managing day-to-day operations.
* Collaborating effectively with external open source communities.

## What’s Not in This Book

This book does not focus on how to develop open source software or explain technical details in depth.

It also does not provide step-by-step instructions for using, deploying, or contributing to specific open source software projects. 

## Who Should Read This Book?
