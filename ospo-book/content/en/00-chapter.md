## What's This Book About?

For any organization working with software—not just software companies—open source software has become unavoidable. So learning to work with, manage, and contribute to open source software is becoming increasingly important for many organizations. One way to manage open source operations is by setting up an Open Source Program Office (OSPO). And as more organizations adopt this approach, they generate experience and knowledge about how to do it successfully. 

In the open source spirit, this book aims to make that knowledge available to that growing commuity of open source program management practitioners. It provides a clear introduction for anyone who wants to understand how OSPOs help organizations manage open source. It's also a helpful resource for people already working in OSPOs who want to strengthen their role in shaping and managing open source strategy and operations. The book offers practical advice on topics such as:

* building an open source strategy,
* setting up an OSPO,
* managing day-to-day operations, and 
* collaborating effectively with external open source communities

## What's Not in This Book

This book doesn't focus on how to develop open source software, nor does it explain technical details in much depth. It also doesn't provide step-by-step instructions for using, deploying, or contributing to specific open source software projects.

## Who Should Read This Book?

This book is for readers who need clear, actionable guidance on how open source governance, risk management, and community engagement. It discusses ways practitioners can develope, integrate, and scale these processes in their organizations, and who might benefit from a structured guidebook for implementing best practices.

* **Executives, policymakers, and decision-makers** who are responsible for setting up, supporting, or funding an OSPO.
* **Open source program managers and team leads** who coordinate open source activities and build relationships with open source communities.
* **Legal and compliance professionals** who handle legal matters related to open source, such as licensing and intellectual property.

The second edition of this book aims to make it useful for additional audiences, including: 

* **Leaders and practitioners** who are establishing or refining open-source-related processes, aligning them with existing management, compliance, and risk frameworks, or evaluating how an OSPO contributes to broader organizational objectives.
* **Educators and trainers** introducing open source program management to students and professionals across fields such as computer science, business, law, and engineering, including those designing modular curricula or standalone teaching units.
* **New and experienced contributors to open source programs** who require a structured pathway—assembled from focused chapters and supported with bridging material—to build organizational capability, upstream engagement, and supply-chain awareness.
