* The guide will include a comprehensive review of existing literature and resources on open source and Open Source Program Offices, including reports, articles, whitepapers, and books.

* The guide will also provide a list of essential resources that organizations can use to further their understanding of open source and OSPOs, including online courses, webinars, and industry events.

* Additionally, the guide will highlight key organizations and initiatives that are leading the way in open source and OSPOs, providing organizations with a network of resources and support as they navigate their open source journey.
