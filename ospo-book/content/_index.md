# Welcome to the <br/>OSPO Book

Welcome to the glossary for the Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). As you may know, the world of open source is vast and complex, with many different terms and concepts that can be difficult to navigate. Our aim with this glossary is not to provide a definitive or general definition of these terms, but to clarify what we mean specifically under the context of an OSPO framework (stratey, governance, compliance and community) for organizations.

As you explore the terms and concepts in this glossary, we encourage you to use the descriptions and links provided. And if you have any suggestions for additional terms or resources that we should include, please don't hesitate to open an Issue or include new terms by opening a PR!
