## üß© Project Description

Open source software is increasingly being adopted by organizations of all sizes and industries, making it essential for organizations to have a clear and well-defined open source strategy and operations. This guide aims to help organizations understand the value of having an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) within their organization and provide a step-by-step guide on how to create and implement an OSPO.

The guide will be aimed at organizations of all sizes and industries, including those just starting their open source journey as well as those looking to streamline and improve their existing open source operations. It will provide practical, actionable advice and real-world examples to help organizations streamline their open source operations and achieve their goals.
