## Project Description

Open source software is increasingly being adopted by organizations of all sizes and industries, making it essential for organizations to have a clear and well-defined open source strategy and operations. This guide aims to help organizations understand the value of having an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) within their organization and provide a step-by-step guide on how to create and implement an OSPO.

The guide will be aimed at organizations of all sizes and industries, including those just starting their open source journey as well as those looking to streamline and improve their existing open source operations. It will provide practical, actionable advice and real-world examples to help organizations streamline their open source operations and achieve their goals.

This guide will be a valuable resource for organizations looking to improve their open source operations and take advantage of the many benefits that come with having an OSPO.

## Goals

The guide will cover the following topics:

1. Understanding the value of Open Source Program Offices: The guide will explore the reasons why organizations need to foster an OSPO within their organization, including increased transparency, efficiency, and innovation, and provide insight into how organizations can create an OSPO depending on their sector and region.
2. Involvement in Open Source Program Operations: The guide will provide practical tips and best practices for organizations looking to be involved in open source program operations on a daily basis, including what constitutes a minimum viable OSPO, how to create and implement an open source strategy, and a deep dive into OSPO responsibilities.
3. Measuring Success and Impact: The guide will provide guidance on how to measure the success and impact of an OSPO, including how to track and measure key performance indicators and use metrics to drive continuous improvement.
