# Author's Guide

Guidance on how to write content for the OSPO Book and prepare it for submission.

## Follow the chapter structure
Your chapter should follow this structure:

> ### Introduction
> Explain the goals of the chapter - what will the reader be learning about?
>
> ### *Your Chapter headings*
> Include as many content-driven headings as you need. Take a look at other chapters for examples.
> 
> ### Applying This to Your Organization
> Show how to use the ideas and techniques you presented in this chapter.
> 
> ### Possible Problems and how to Overcome Them
> Use the "Problem" and "Recommendation" format to share possible challenges and practical ways to address them. 
> 
> ### Resources and Footnotes
> Hyperlinks are not permitted in the book because it is also used in a print format. All links should be provided as full URLs by using footnotes.

## Use the writing style guide
For specific guidance on writing style, you must read https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/.vale/TODO/README.md 

## Use markdown

Markdown helps you to write content in a formatted way while making it easier to create lists, headings, etc, without learning complex syntax.  Book content must be in Markdown format at the point you add it to the `todogroup/ospology` repository on GitHub. For more information about Markdown, see:
* [A beginner's guide for using basic markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
* [Markdown Syntax reference](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Run pre-commit checks locally
