# Author's Guide

Guidance on how to write content for the OSPO Book and prepare it for submission.

## Follow the chapter structure

## Use the writing style guide

## Use markdown

Markdown helps in writing content in a formatted way while making it easier to denote lists, headings, etc, without learning complex syntax. A beginner's guide for using basic markdown can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). Markdown Syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). When uploading to GitHub, the format needs to **stay** the same, i.e. it only needs to be in Markdown.

## Run pre-commit checks locally

* Build the site locally to check if it looks right. 
* Run `Vale` checks locally using the `pre-commit` tool.
