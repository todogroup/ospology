drivers of motivation for the actors they will interact with and align their goals with the overall 
mission of the organization.

> RE ML disussion: https://lists.todogroup.org/g/ospo-book-project/message/5


This pillar focuses on the transmission of knowledge to different player who have a direct or indirect 
impact on the OSPO. It examines the OSPO in four different directions:

* `⬇️ Down`: as the head of an OSPO I need to manage what the OSPO team does. What do they do? That depends on the OSPO, but either way, there’s a basic need to manage a group. 

* `⬆️ Up`: as the head of a group (or someone proposing the creation of one) I need to manage expectations and needs with respect to my executive’s technology needs.

* `↔️ Sideways`: An OSPO need to work with others. For intance, in `business-oriented` OSPO, these include the dev tools team, the security team.  

* `🛸 Outside`: An OSPO represents the organization to the external communities and foundations. What is our method of integration?
