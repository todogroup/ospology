## What is OSPOlogy?
OSPOlogy is an initiative by the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/). Our community's collective resources, including frameworks and templates, are freely available for any organization to use, providing proper attribution to the repository and brand.

## Forum
The [official forum](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions) facilitates discussions on open source program management, exploring its role across specializations (e.g., security, AI infrastructure, business strategy), addressing shared challenges (e.g., measuring the value of open source management and OSPOs), and fostering community-driven proposals.

## Resources
OSPOlogy contributors create resources with the support of the [TODO Community](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org). Our resources are for anyone seeking knowledge of open source program management. They provide guidance on common best practices for managing open source programs in a range of institutional contexts. The materials we create are provided in a range of forms that support the different goals that readers have, from learning concepts to checking the meaning of an industry term. These goals are supported by providing content in in four documentation archetypes, *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference*, and *explanation*. [Read more about the documentation archetype model at Divio.com.](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)

> [!note]
> By using OSPOlogy resources and attributing them to the community, your organization is helping unify efforts and enhancing the visibility of the strategic value of open source management talent across diverse industries and business areas to key stakeholders, reducing resource fragmentation and duplication.

The [Glossary](https://todogroup.org/resources/glossary/) is a catalog of key terms relevant to the open source program management profession. While it is a reference volume, it doesn't provide definitive or general definitions. Instead, it clarifies what members of the OSPOlogy community mean when using these terms in the context of an OSPO framework (strategy, governance, compliance, and community) in their organizations.

The guide is being developed collaboratively and is intended for decision-makers, OSPO practitioners, and stakeholders looking to better connect open source activities with business objectives. Contributions and ongoing development are tracked in a [dedicated folder](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/business_guide_dev/whitepapers/business-value/content/en).

The [OSPO MindMap](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) provides a visual representation of an open source program office's responsibilities, roles, behaviors, and team size within the ecosystem. This resource charts the ever-shifting landscape in which OSPOs operate, and is designed to be updated regularly as that terrain shifts and evolves.

Contributors can propose updates for future versions in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/ospo-mindmap).  

### Studies
*[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): Explanation*  
Our [Studies](https://todogroup.org/resources/studies/) highlight open source management best practices through in-depth study and research papers. They are useful for achieving a deeper understanding of what an OSPO is and why it is important for organizations.

### Training Modules
*[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): How-to guides*  
[Training Modules](https://todogroup.org/resources/training/) are our community's educational materials. Each features explicit learning objectives aimed at helping train and empower new OSPO professionals on their [career paths](https://github.com/todogroup/ospo-career-path). We've designed them to be modular, remixable, and suitable for educational contexts. Taken together, they constitute our learning curriculum.

### Guides

[Guides](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/) outline best practices from leading companies engaged in open source development, and aim to help organizations successfully implement and run an open source program office. Guides don't simply explain concepts; they prescribe best practices for achieving specific goals.

### Case Studies

[Case Studies](https://todogroup.org/resources/case-studies/) from OSPOlogy highlight examples of organizations across various sectors who have achieved success with some aspect of open source program management.
