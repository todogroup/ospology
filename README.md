## Our Mission

OSPOlogy is an initiative initiated by [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/). The [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org) is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective Open Source Program Offices or similar Open Source initiatives. TODO Group is formed by its [Community participants](https://todogroup.org/community), [General Members](https://todogroup.org/members) and OSPO Associates. Please note that community calls are done under OSPOlogy branding and content is stored in this repo.

> Note: If you are supporting TODO as General Member, please visit the [General Member Onboarding guide](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/onboarding/general-member.md#general-member-onboarding) to also join General Member Touchpoint calls.

## Community

TODO has a community page with an onboarding list that shares the networking spaces and communication channels: https://todogroup.org/community.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è OSPOlogyLive Mini-Summits

Ongoing in-person mini-summits co-organized by various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics. The aim is that people can talk openly about their organization's open source challenges and work together on shared solutions. 

This initiative aims to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics to help organizations effectively implement OSPO Programs based on specific region needs.
