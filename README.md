## What is OSPOlogy?

OSPOlogy is an initiative by the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/). Our community's collective resources, including frameworks and templates, are freely available for any organization to use, providing proper attribution to the repository and brand.

## Forum

The [official forum](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions) facilitates discussions on open source program management, exploring its role across specializations (e.g., security, AI infrastructure, business strategy), addressing shared challenges (e.g., measuring the value of open source management and OSPOs), and fostering community-driven proposals.

## Resources
OSPOlogy contributors create resources with the support of the [TODO Community](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org). Our resources are for anyone seeking knowledge of open source program management. They provide guidance on common best practices for managing open source programs in a range of institutional contexts. The materials we create are provided in a range of forms that support the different goals that readers have, from learning concepts to checking the meaning of an industry term. These goals are supported by providing content in in four documentation archetypes, _tutorials_, _how-to guides_, _technical reference_ and _explanation_. [Read more about the documentation archetype model at Divio.com.](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)

> [!note]
> By using OSPOlogy resources and attributing them to the community, your organization is helping unify efforts and enhancing the visibility of the strategic value of open source management talent across diverse industries and business areas to key stakeholders, reducing resource fragmentation and duplication.

### Glossary 
[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): Reference guide
The [Glossary](https://todogroup.org/resources/glossary/) is a catalog of key terms relevant to the open source program management profession. While it is a reference volume, it doesn't provide definitive or general definitions. Instead, it clarifies what members of the OSPOlogy community mean when using these terms in the context of an OSPO framework (strategy, governance, compliance, and community) in their organizations.

### OSPO Book
[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): Explanation
The [OSPO Book](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/) provides an introduction to open source program offices, open source program management practices, and key considerations for open source program management professionals. It is an explanatory text intended for both novice and seasoned practitioners developing strategies for using, contributing to, or creating open source projects to achieve organizational goals.

### Studies
[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): Explanation
Our [Studies](https://todogroup.org/resources/studies/) highlight open source management best practices through in-depth study and research papers. They are useful for achieving a deeper understanding of what an OSPO is and why it is important for organizations.

### MindMap
[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): Explanation
The [OSPO MindMap](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) provides a visual representation of an open source program office's responsibilities, roles, behaviors, and team size within the ecosystem. This resource charts the ever-shifting landscape in which OSPOs operate, and is designed to be updated regularly as that terrain shifts and evolves.

### Training Modules
[Archetype](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/): How-to guides
[Training Modules](https://todogroup.org/resources/training/) are our community's educational materials. Each features explicit learning objectives aimed at helping train and empower new OSPO professionals on their [career paths](https://github.com/todogroup/ospo-career-path). We've designed them to be modular, remixable, and suitable for educational contexts. Taken together, they constitute our learning curriculum.

### Guides
[Guides](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/) outline best practices from leading companies engaged in open source development, and aim to help organizations successfully implement and run an open source program office. Guides don't simply explain concepts; they prescribe best practices for achieving specific goals.

### Case Studies
[Case Studies](https://todogroup.org/resources/case-studies/) from OSPOlogy highlight exmaples of organizations across various sectors who have achieved success with some aspect of open source program management. We collect them to share concrete examples of best practices in specific organizational and industry contexts.

### In-person

#### ⭐️ OSPOlogy Birds of a Feather (BoF)

Formerly called OSPO BoFs, this framework consists of semi-informal discussion sessions held at conferences, where participants with shared interests come together to discuss open source management and OSPO challenges and its strategic value in security, innovation, and collaboration within different industries, specializations, or technologies (e.g. Cloud Native, Energy, Automotive, Security, etc.). Current adopters include the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
