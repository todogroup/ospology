# What is OSPOlogy?  

OSPOlogy is an initiative by the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/). Our collective resources, including frameworks and templates, are freely available for any organization to use, providing proper attribution to the repository and brand.

## Forum 

The official forum (OSPOlogy GH Discussions) facilitates discussions on open source management, exploring its role across specializations (e.g., security, AI infrastructure, business strategy), addressing shared challenges (e.g., measuring the value of open source management and OSPOs), and fostering community-driven proposals.  

## Activities and Frameworks  

> [!note]  
> By using OSPOlogy frameworks and attributing the brand, your organization is helping unify efforts and enhancing the visibility of the strategic value of open source management talent across diverse industries and business areas to key stakeholders, reducing resource fragmentation and duplication.

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è OSPOlogy Birds of a Feather (BoF)

Formerly called OSPO BoFs, this framework consists of semi-informal discussion sessions held at conferences, where participants with shared interests come together to discuss open source management and OSPO challenges and its strategic value in security, innovation, and collaboration within different industries, specializations, or technologies (e.g. Cloud Native, Energy, Automotive, Security, etc.).
