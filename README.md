# üìñ OSPOlogy: The Study of OSPOs

‚ú® **`OSPOlogy` hosts the study and open community communication to discuss the status of open source program offices across regions.**

## üöÄ Our Mission

The [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org) is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective Open Source Program Offices or similar Open Source initiatives. TODO Group is formed by its [Community participants](https://todogroup.org/community) and [General Members](https://todogroup.org/members).

## ü¶∫ Community

TODO has a community page with an onboarding list that shares the networking spaces and communication channels: https://todogroup.org/community/. To participate in OSPO related discussions you can [submit questions](https://github.com/todogruop/ospology/discussions) or join the [TODO Group Slack](https://slack.todogroup.org). 

### üî≠ Global Community Meetings: OSPOlogy

The global and public monthly TODO Group and wider OSPO community's meetings. These meetings have featured OSPO-related topics with special guests and community discussions. All these meetings are recorded, edited, and recorder on Youtube OSPOlogy Channel, so everyone across the globe can have access to it via: https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings#event-page-and-past-sessions

Everyone is welcome to attend the monthly TODO Group [OSPOlogy community meeting](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group/) hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org).


### üó∫ Regional Sync Call

Location-based meetings with a slightly different structure than OSPOlogy meetings. The community adds topics of matter into an agenda and we have discussions the entire hour. We currently have Europe Sync and APAC Sync calls. Both are available in the community page calendar: https://todogroup.org/community/

**TODO Europe Sync Call**

The TODO Europe chapter was formed by TODO Members based in Europe. This chapter was created with the aim of working together to improve OSPO adoption and education within Europe and discuss with the broader community the challenges European organizations face when implementing an open source program under Chatham House Rules.

EMEA-friendly time meetings are [scheduled](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group-europe/) every last Thursday of the month at 1PM (UTC).

**TODO APAC Sync Call**

TODO APAC Sync meetings were created with the aim of working together to improve OSPO adoption and education within the different APAC regions and discuss with the broader community the challenges these organizations face when implementing an open source program or a similar initiative, under Chatham House Rules.

APAC-friendly time meetings are [scheduled](ttps://todogroup.org/community/) every last Monday of the month at 8AM (UTC). People can join TODO slack channel `#chapter-apac` and check past meeting notes [here](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings/Sync%20Chapters/APAC-notes)
